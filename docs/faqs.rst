How many Material are included?
****************************************

26 Hologram Materials of which 6 are lights (Light) and 20 are materials (Material)

For all 26 materials there are 2 different versions, (In reality, counting the group nodes there would be 3 versions)

- The version for Asset Browser contains 26 Materials and 26 Group Nodes, the group nodes can be used to mix
  your material with that of the Cyber Hologram and create gradient effects.

- The version for Extreme PBR contains all 26 materials, the mixing with the materials in Extreme PBR
  takes place through the **Shader Overlay** function which precisely applies the Cyber Hologram material over the material in
  so that they can be mixed with any other material.

Why is there a version for Extreme PBR?

The version for Extreme PBR was created to allow the use of Cyber Hologram materials, it makes it easier

This is not necessarily necessary, Cyber Hologram also works in Asset Browser. It's just easier to use it with Extreme PBR.
